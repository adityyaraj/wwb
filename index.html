                    <p>Wastewater is water whose physical, chemical or biological properties have been changed as a result 
                        of the introduction of certain substances which render it unsafe for some purposes such as drinking. The day to
                         day activities of man is mainly water dependent and therefore discharge ‘waste’ into water. Some of the substances include body wastes (faeces and urine), 
                         hair shampoo, hair, food scraps, fat, laundry powder, fabric conditioners, which can make people ill and damage the environment.
