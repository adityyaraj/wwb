            <div><p>WaterSense labels weather-based irrigation controllers, a type of "smart" irrigation control technology that uses local weather
                 data to determine when and how much to water. WaterSense labeled irrigation controllers can save you water, time, and money when 
                 compared to standard models.</p></div>

                <h2>Low-Flow Faucets and Fixtures</h2>
            </div>
            <div><p>If you’ve checked out the faucet and fixture aisle at your home improvement center recently, you’ve 
                undoubtedly seen numerous showerheads, toilets, and sink faucets labeled as low flow, with added claims of
                 reducing water consumption. The term “low flow” refers to fixtures that use a lesser amount of water to accomplish 
                 everyday activities, such as showering, washing your hands, or flushing the toilet. In some cases, low-flow fixtures can
                  reduce water usage by as much as 60 percent over standard fixtures.</p></div>

                <h2>Toilet Tank Fill Cycle Diverters</h2>
            </div>
            <div><p>Fill cycle diverters reduce water utilization by diverting some water that would typically fill the toilet bowl to the tank. This technology uses less water for the toilet bowl and tank, which can reduce water utilization by up to 1/2 gallon per flush. Some toilet tank diverters offer multiple configurations, which can include water level reduction.

                Customizing fill cycle diverters allows landlords to make adjustments according to tenant needs or property management's preferences. In contrast, while toilet tank bags are among the lowest costs toilet technologies, they are relatively easy for tenants to remove.
                
                Landlords should consider the importance of regular leak inspection on toilet tanks to facilitate ongoing cost savings. The Water Scrooge's white glove installation service includes toilet tank inspection for the presence of leaky toilets, increased water use per flush, as well as follow-up leak detection.</p></div>

                <h2>Leak Detection System</h2>
            </div>
            <div><p>Being that leaks are spontaneous and impossible to predict, finding leaks before they cause major damage is vital. Most leak detectors in the market are usually battery-operated discs or small square boxes that can be easily installed and placed on the floor where you could suspect a possible water leak. Unfortunately, not all leaks are created equal and there’s always the possibility that the leak won't just be on the floor.

                A great, well-engineered solution that is revolutionizing the leak detector market is the Water Scrooge™ Leak Detection System. The Water Scrooge™ Leak Detection System has an ultrasound sensor that is clamped to the building's water risers and communicates to the system's hub, transmitting the data collected from the sensors to your smartphone in real time.
                
                The Water Scrooge™ Leak Detection System doesn't even require a plumber, making it super easy for landlord's to install. Once the system is clamped on the riser, you can sync it with an app to get a bird’s eye view of all the water fixtures in your building.</p></div>

                <h2>Water Flow Management Device</h2>
            </div>
            <div><p>Every time we take a shower, flush a toilet or let the sink run it causes the pressure to drop, therefore increasing the volume of air. Water meters that measure by volume, use the method known as Positive Displacement. This is the most common method used to measure water consumption, which measures the total volume read, including both water and air.

                By using water conservation technologies such as a water flow management device, like The Water Scrooge™, you can compress the air before it reaches the water meter. As a result, your water meter measures only the water volume and no excess air.
                
                The Water Scrooge's SMART VALVE™ is designed by engineers to be installed in an existing pipe joint on the user side of the water meter and can be easily installed by any licensed plumber, eliminating water meter inaccuracy and excessive water consumption.</p></div>
